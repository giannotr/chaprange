# The `chaprange` package

This small package adds (only) a single but hopefully useful feature.
It enables the user to employ to range of a chapter along to the starting page number.
By default page ranges will be added to the chapter entries in the table of contents.
But, this can be bypassed if the user wants to retrieve the page range by hand only.

The easiest way to use the package is by simply calling

    \usepackage{chaprange}

This alredy enables the core features.
For more details about modifying the packages behaviour have a look at the documentation.

This is version 0.99a of the package.
